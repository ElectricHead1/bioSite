    <p class="about-text">
      Luis Espejo and I have been friends for the past two years. He is a
      Venezuelan native. Because of the civil instability in Venezuela, Luis
      relocated to the United States. Just like most Immigrates coming to the
      United States from non-English speaking countries, He has had his own
      challenges with English and, of course, challenges of transitioning.
      Regardless of all those challenges, Luis triumphs. Luis now works and
      speaks English fluently.

    <p class="about-text">
      Luis is quite a busy man, he works six days a week. However, he managed
      to do so much in the little time he gets. Fun fact, Luis and I met at a
      soccer field after his team lost to my team. Luis plays goalkeeper for a
      local second-division team. Luis is also the captain and goalkeeper for
      Team Venezuela in the International Unity Cup league hosted every summer
      in the city to bring people together.
